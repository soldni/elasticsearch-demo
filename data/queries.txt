<title> Topic: Control of Food Supplements

<desc> Description:
Should the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) exercise
more stringent control over the labelling and sale of
food supplements.

<narr> Narrative:
Food supplements include vitamins, herbal preparations,
minerals and amino acids.  It is estimated that nearly
half of all Americans take some dietary supplement every day.
Until recent years there has been little concern that there
has been no federal rules covering this four billion dollar
a year industry.  The government has become concerned with the
purity of the products, and points to deaths and injuries which
have occurred because of the contamination of certain
supplements.  The government is also concerned about
the exaggerated claims made for some products, and the
lack of warning labels on the products.  Those who take
the opposite side of the argument say that the FDA wants
to eventually control supplements as if they were drugs.
Any item which addresses either side of the argument would be
relevant.
